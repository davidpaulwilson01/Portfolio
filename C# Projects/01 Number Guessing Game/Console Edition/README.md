# NumberGuesser Console Edition
## Last Update: Version 1.0, released on May 22, 2023
## Overview
This simple game was the first project I used to teach myself C#. The object of the game is to guess a random target number between 0 and 100 within three tries. It does not include any kind of validation, and the game ends as soon as the user either guesses correctly or runs out of turns. It is fully playable inside a console window so long as the user is careful to enter their guesses as valid integers.

There are no plans to build on this game any further at this time. It has been replaced by the WinForm version available [here](https://github.com/davidpaulwilson01/Portfolio/tree/main/C%23%20Projects/01%20Number%20Guessing%20Game/WinForm%20Edition).
