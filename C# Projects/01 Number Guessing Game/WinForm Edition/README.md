# NumberGuesser WinForm Edition
## Last Update: Version 2.0, released on June 04, 2023
## Overview
This simple game is based on an older project of the same name available [here](https://github.com/davidpaulwilson01/Portfolio/tree/main/C%23%20Projects/01%20Number%20Guessing%20Game/Console%20Edition). The object of the game is to guess a randomly selected number from 0 to 100. I began this project to teach myself how to develop Windows GUI applications in Windows Forms (Winform). It is fully playable in its current state.
