# Welcome to David Wilson's Portfolio!  
This repository contains my coding experiments and samples of my work in writing and document design.
## C# Projects
Starting on May 13, 2023, I decided to teach myself how to use C# and .Net. I began by taking free lessons on Code Academy. I later moved on to a more freeform structure, developing personal projects and learning new topics as they became important. In particular, I wanted to learn how to develop GUI applications for Windows.
### Number Guesser
My first project was a simple number-guessing game. The idea was to pick a random number between 0 and 100, then see how long it took the user to guess that number. The original version of this project was designed to use the console, but I soon created a new version to explore Windows Forms (Winform). These projects are linked here:
- [Number Guesser Console Edition v1](https://github.com/davidpaulwilson01/Portfolio/tree/main/C%23%20Projects/01%20Number%20Guessing%20Game/Console%20Edition)
- [Number Guesser Winform Edition v2](https://github.com/davidpaulwilson01/Portfolio/tree/main/C%23%20Projects/01%20Number%20Guessing%20Game/WinForm%20Edition/NumberGuesserWinForm)


## Software Engineering Projects
Starting on June 11, 2023, I decided to learn more about the larger process of Software Engineering (SWE) beyond just writing code. I intend to practice designing software artifacts and documentation for each of the following five phases of development in order: Requirements, Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Testing.
### Book Inventory System (BIS)
My first SWE project is an inventory management and sales tracking system intended for a single location bookstore. It should enable the user to search inventory, check stock on a given ISBN, place orders for new stock via "intake," make sales, add employees, and track customer loyalty program membership.

## Writing Samples
Over the course of my Computer Science degree, I learned to aim my fondness for writing in more technical directions. This section includes samples of my work in technical writing and document design, as well as a more general writing sample in the form of a research paper on the topic of Kanban.
